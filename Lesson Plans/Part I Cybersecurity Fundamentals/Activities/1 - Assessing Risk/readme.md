Scenario 1:

> A vulnerability was discovered on a public-facing web server with an application that stores, processes, and transmits NPI - NonPublic Information. It is your job as a risk analyst to identify the level of risk based on the risk matrix.
  

* **Vulnerability**: A webserver was found to be running TLS v1.0 when the lowest secure version of TLS at the time was TLS 2.0.

Questions:

* What is the impact?
* What is the likelihood if the threat is a (MITM) Man-in-the-Middle attack? Explain your reasoning.
* Using the formula Risk = Likelihood x Impact (use the matrix), what is the risk level?

Scenario 2:

> A vulnerability was discovered on an internal web server with an application that stores, processes, and transmits NPI - NonPublic Information. It is your job as a risk analyst to identify the level of risk based on the risk matrix.
  

* **Vulnerability**: A webserver was found to be running TLS v1.0 when the lowest secure version of TLS at the time was TLS 2.0.

Questions:

* What is the impact?
* What is the likelihood if the threat is a (MITM) Man-in-the-Middle attack? Explain your reasoning.
* Using the formula Risk = Likelihood x Impact (use the matrix), what is the risk level?
